artificial intelligence
I see that artificial intelligence is not just a complex technology, it is a mirror that reflects our way of thinking and our ability to solve problems intelligently. I am inclined to ideas that combine human logic and technical innovation, so I chose a project that reflects my passion for organization and efficiency.

The idea: "a smart assistant to understand and avoid burnout"
The idea, in short:
An artificial intelligence system that analyzes your daily routine (such as working hours, emails, and even your tone of voice in meetings) to detect signs of stress before it gets worse, and provides personalized tips to improve your productivity and mental health.

Why this idea

Because it touches the reality of people (we all suffer from work stress!).

Artificial intelligence is used practically and concretely (not just theories).

It fits my personality as a competent coach who likes to turn chaos into order using data.

How can I build it

Data collection:

From applications such as Google Calendar or record screen time (screen time).

Analyze the tone of e-mail using models such as Bert.

The model:

Machine learning algorithms (for example, to predict future stresses).

The experiment:

A simple application that shows me a daily report:
"Beware! Tomorrow you may have a stressful day due to a lot of meetings. Try to distribute tasks on weekdays!"

Why do I believe in this project
Because it is not limited to technology, it touches people's lives and makes them better.

It corresponds to my passion for analyzing patterns and improving performance (both at work and in personal life).

My final opinion:
Artificial intelligence should be a servant of mankind, not a master of it. And this project is a simple but profound example of making it happen!
